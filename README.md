# arima_time_series
ARIMA stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model. This is a type of forecasting model used for time series data. This model captures suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data.

The acronym is descriptive

AR: Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.

I: Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations (e.g. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary.

MA: Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.


p: The number of lag observations included in the model, also called the lag order.

d: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced, also called the degree of differencing.

q: The size of the moving average window, also called the order of moving average.
